	<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
		<div class="half-width">
			<p>I’ve made my home base in Phoenix, Arizona (for now) with my small family. My journey into tech started with a degree in psychology. When I returned to Arizona from living in Hawaii for several years I was looking to start fresh. I got into tech again and began working on a help desk in an organization that had a learning environment. If you wanted to learn something you were encouraged to do so & when things were not busy more seasoned professionals were willing to answer questions and give examples. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="half-width">
			<p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. I learned how to build my first website and I realized I found something that gave me the freedom, versatility and creativity I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to web development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code. If you are interested in working with me please drop me an email from the email link below. Thanks!</p>
